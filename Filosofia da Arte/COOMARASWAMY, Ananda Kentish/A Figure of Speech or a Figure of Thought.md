We are peculiar people. I say this with reference to the fact that whereas almost all other peoples have called their theory of art or expression a "rhetoric" and have thought of art as a kind of knowledge, we have invented an "aesthetic" and think of art as a kind of feeling.

The Greek original of the word "aesthetic" means perception by the senses, especially by feeling. Aesthetic experience is a faculty that we share with animals and vegetables, and is irrational. The "aesthetic soul" is that part of our psychic makeup that "senses" things and reacts to them: in other words, the "sentimental" part os us. To identify our approach to art with the pursuit of these reactions is not to make art "fine" but to apply it only to the life of pleasure and to disconnect it from the active and contemplative lives.

Our word "aesthetic", then, takes for granted what is now commonly assumed, viz. that art is evoked by, and has for its end to express and again evoke, emotions. In this connection, Alfred North Whitehead has remarked that "it was a tremendous dicovery, how to excie emotions for their own sake."[<sup>3</sup>](#3)<a id="note3"></a> We have gone on to invent a science of our likes and dislikes, a "a science of the soul", psychology, and have substituted psychological explanations for the traditional conception of art as an intellectual virtue and of beauty as pertaining to knowledge.[<sup>4</sup>](#4)<a id="note4"></a> Our current resentment of meaning in art is as strong as the word "aesthetic" implies. When we speak of a work of art as "significant" we try to forget that this word can only be used with a following "of", that expressioan can be significant only *of* some thesis that was to be expressed, and we overlook that whatever does not mean something is literally *in-significant*. If, indeed, the whole end of art were "to express emotion", then the degree of our emotional reaction would be the measure of beauty and all judgment would be subjectivem for there can be no disputing about tastes. It should be remembered that a reaction is an "affection", and every affection a passion, that is, something passively suffered or undergone, and not — as in the operation of judgment — an activity on our part.[<sup>5</sup>](#5)<a id="note5"></a> To equate the love of art with a love of fine sensations is to make of works of art a kind of aphrodisiac. The words "disinterested aesthetic contemplation" are a contradiction in terms and pure non-sense.

"Rhetoric", of which the Greek original means skill in public speaking, implies, on the other hand, a theory of art as the effective expression of theses. There is a very wide difference between what is said for effect, and what is said or made to be *effective*, and must *work*, or would not have been worth saying or making. It is true that there is a so-called rhetoric of the production of "effects", just as there is a so-called poetry that consists only of emotive words, and a sort of painting that is merely spectacular; but this kind of eloquence that makes use of figures for thier own sake, or merely to display the artist, or to betray the truth in courts fo law, is not properly a rhetoric, but sophistic, or art of flattery. By "rhetoric" we mean, with Plato and Aristotle, "the art of giving effectiveness to truth".[<sup>6</sup>](#6)<a id="note6"></a> My thesis will be, then, that if we propose to use or understand any works of art (with the possible exception of contemporary works, which may be "unintelligible"[<sup>7</sup>](#7)<a id="note7"></a>), we ought to abandon the term "aesthetic" in its present application and return to "rhetoric", Quintilian's "bene dicendi scientia".

It may be objected by those for whom art is not a language but a spectacle that rhetoric has primarily to do with verbal eloquence and not with the life of works of art in general. I am not sure that even such objectors would really agree to describe their own works as dumb or ineloquent. But however this may be, we must affirm that the principles of art are not altered by the variety of the material in which the artist works — materials such as vibrant air in the case of music or poetry, human flesh on the stage, or stone, metal, clay in architecture, sculpture, and pottery. Nor can one material be called more beautiful than another; you cannot make a better sword of gold than of steel. Indeed, the material as such, being relatively formless, is relatively ugly. Art implies a transformation of the material, the impression of a new form on material that had been more or less formless; and it is precisely in this sense that the creation of the world from a completely formless matter is called a "work of adornment".

There are good reasons for the fact that the theory of art has generally been stated in terms of the spoken (or secondarily, written) word. It is, in the first place, "by a word conceived in intellect" that the artist, whether human or divine, works.[<sup>8</sup>](#8)<a id="note8"></a> Again, those whose own art was, like mine, verbal, naturally discussed the art of verbal expression, while those who worked in other materials were not also necessarily expert in "logical" formulation. And finally, the art of speaking can be better understood by all than could the art of, let us say, the potter, because all men make use of speech (whether rhetorically, to communicate a meaning, or sophistically, to exhibit themselves), while relatively few are workers in clay. 

All our sources are conscious of the fundamental identity of all the arts. Plato, for example, remarks that "the expert, who is intent upon the best when he speaks, will surely not speak at random, but with an end in view; he is just like all those other artists, the painters, builders, ship-wrights, etc.";[<sup>9</sup>](#9)<a id="note9"></a> and again, "the productions of all arts are kinds of poetry, and their craftsmen are all poets",[<sup>10</sup>](#10)<a id="note10"></a> in the broad sense of the word. "Demiurge" (*dêmiourgos*) and "technician" (*technitês*) are the ordinary Greek words for "artist" (*artifex*), and under these headings Plato includes not only poets, painters, and musicians, but also archers, weavers, embroiderers, potters, carpenters, sculptors, farmers, doctors, hunters, and above all those whose art is government, only making a distinction between creation (*dêmiourgia*) and mere labor (*cheirourgia*), art (*technê*) and artless industry (*atechnos tribê*).[<sup>11</sup>](#11)<a id="note11"></a> All these artists, insofar as they are really makers and not merely industrious, insofar as they are musical and therefore wise and good, and insofar as they are in possession of their art (*entechnos*, cf. *entheos*) and governed by it, are infallible.[<sup>12</sup>](#12)<a id="note12"></a> The primary meaning of the word *sophia*, "wisdom", is that of "skill", just as Sanskrit *kausalam* is "skill" of any kind, whether in making, doing, or knowing.

Now what are all these arts for? Always and only to supply a real or an imagined need or deficiency on the part of the human patron, for whom as the collective consumer the artist works.[<sup>13</sup>](#13)<a id="note13"></a> When he is working for himself, the artist as a human being is also a consumer. The necessities to be served by art may appear to be material *or* spiritual, but as Plato insists, it is one and the same art — or a combination of both arts, practical and philosophical—that must serve both body and soul if it is to be admitted in the ideal City.[<sup>14</sup>](#14)<a id="note14"></a> We shall see presently that to propose to serve the two ends separately is the peculiar symptom of our modern "heartlessness". Our distinction of "fine" from "applied" art (ridiculous, because the fine art itself is applied to giving pleasure) is as though "not by bread alone"[<sup>15</sup>](#15)<a id="note15"></a> had meant "by cake" for the elite that go to exhibitions and "bread alone" for the majority and usually for all. Plato’s music and gymnastics, which correspond to what we seem to intend by "fine" and "applied" art (since one is for the soul and the other for the body), are never divorced in his theory of education; to follow one alone leads to effeminacy, to follow only the other, to brutality; the tender artist is no more a man than the tough athlete; music must be realized in bodily graces, and physical power should be exercised only in measured, not in violent motions.[<sup>16</sup>](#16)<a id="note16"></a>

"I cannot fairly give the name of 'art' to anything irrational". Cf. *Laws* 890D, "Law and art are children of the intellect" (*nous*). Sensation (*aisthêsis*) and pleasure (*hêdône*) are irrational (alogos, see *Timaeus* 28A, 47D, 69D). In the *Gorgias*, the irrational is that which cannot give an account of itself, that which is unreasonable, has no *raison d'être*. See also Philo, *Legum Allegoriarum* I.48, "For as grass is the fod of irrational beings, so has the sensibly-perceptible (*to aisthêton*) ben assigned to the irrational part of the soul". *Aisthêsis* is just what the biologist now calls "irritability".

"Pathology ... 2. The study of the passions or emotions" (*The Oxford English Dictionary*, 1933, VII, 554). The "psychology of art" is not a science of art but of the way in which we are affected by works of art. An affection (*pathêma*) is passive; making or doing (*poiêma*, *ergon*) is an activity.

See Charles Sears Baldwin, *Medieval Rhetoric and Poetic* (New York, 1928), p. 3. "A real art of speaking which does not lay hold upon the truth does not exist and never will" (*Phaedrus* 260E; cf. *Gorgias* 463-465, 513D, 517A, 527C, *Laws* 937E). [↑](#note6)

See E.F. Rothschild, *The Meaning of Unintelligibility in Modern Art* (Chicago, 1934), p.98. "The course of artistic achievements was the change from the visual as a means of comprehending the non-visual to the visual as an end in itself and the abstract structure of physical forms as the purely artitic transcendence of the visual ... *a transcendence utterly alien and unintelligible* to the average [sc. normal] man" (F. de W. Bolman, criticizing E. Kahler's *Man in Measure*, in *Journal of Philosophy*, XLI, 1944, 134-135; italics mine). [↑](#note7)

See, for example, *Statesman* 259E, *Phaedrus* 260E, *Laws* 938A. The word *tribê* literally means "a rubbing", and is an exact equivalent of our modern expression "a grind". (Cf. Hippocrates, *Fractures* 772, "shameful and artless", and Ruskin’s "industry without art is brutality.") "For all well-governed peoples there is a work enjoined upon each man which he must perform" (*Republic* 406C). "Leisure" is the opportunity to do this work without interference (*Republic* 370C). A "work for leisure" is one requiring undivided attention (Euripides, *Andromache* 552). Plato’s view of work in no way differs from that of Hesiod, who says that work is no reproach but the best gift of the gods to men (*Works and Days* 295-296). Whenever Plato disparages the mechanical arts, it is with reference to the kinds of work that provide for the well-being of the body only, and do not at the same time provide spiritual food; he does not connect culture with idleness.

*Republic* 342BC. What is made by art is correctly made (*Alcibiades* 1.108B). It will follow that those who are in possession of and governed by their art and not by their own irrational impulses, which yearn for innovations, will operate in the same way (*Republic* 349-350, *Laws* 660B). "Art has fixed ends and ascertained means of operation" (Sum. Theol. II-II.47.4 ad 2, 49.5 *ad* 2). It is in the same way that an oracle, speaking *ex cathedra*, is infallible, but not so the man when speaking for himself. This is similarly true in the case of a guru. [↑](#note12)
