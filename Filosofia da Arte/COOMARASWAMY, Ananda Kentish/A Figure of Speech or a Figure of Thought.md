We are peculiar people. I say this with reference to the fact that whereas almost all other peoples have called their theory of art or expression a "rhetoric" and have thought of art as a kind of knowledge, we have invented an "aesthetic" and think of art as a kind of feeling.

The Greek original of the word "aesthetic" means perception by the senses, especially by feeling. Aesthetic experience is a faculty that we share with animals and vegetables, and is irrational. The "aesthetic soul" is that part of our psychic makeup that "senses" things and reacts to them: in other words, the "sentimental" part os us. To identify our approach to art with the pursuit of these reactions is not to make art "fine" but to apply it only to the life of pleasure and to disconnect it from the active and contemplative lives.

Our word "aesthetic", then, takes for granted what is now commonly assumed, viz. that art is evoked by, and has for its end to express and again evoke, emotions. In this connection, Alfred North Whitehead has remarked that "it was a tremendous dicovery, how to excie emotions for their own sake."[<sup>3</sup>](#3)<a id="note3"></a> We have gone on to invent a science of our likes and dislikes, a "a science of the soul", psychology, and have substituted psychological explanations for the traditional conception of art as an intellectual virtue and of beauty as pertaining to knowledge.[<sup>4</sup>](#4)<a id="note4"></a> Our current resentment of meaning in art is as strong as the word "aesthetic" implies. When we speak of a work of art as "significant" we try to forget that this word can only be used with a following "of", that expressioan can be significant only *of* some thesis that was to be expressed, and we overlook that whatever does not mean something is literally *in-significant*. If, indeed, the whole end of art were "to express emotion", then the degree of our emotional reaction would be the measure of beauty and all judgment would be subjectivem for there can be no disputing about tastes. It should be remembered that a reaction is an "affection", and every affection a passion, that is, something passively suffered or undergone, and not — as in the operation of judgment — an activity on our part.[<sup>5</sup>](#3)<a id="note5"></a> To equate the love of art with a love of fine sensations is to make of works of art a kind of aphrodisiac. The words "disinterested aesthetic contemplation" are a contradiction in terms and pure non-sense.

"Rhetoric", of which the Greek original means skill in public speaking, implies, on the other hand, a theory of art as the effective expression of theses. There is a very wide difference between what is said for effect, and what is said or made to be *effective*, and must *work*, or would not have been worth saying or making. It is true that there is a so-called rhetoric of the production of "effects", just as there is a so-called poetry that consists only of emotive words, and

Quintilian IX.4.117, "Figura? Quae? com orationis, turn etiam sententiae?" Cf. Plato, Replubic 601B. [↑](#a-figure-os-speech-or-a-figure-of-though1)

"I cannot fairly give the name of 'art' to anything irrational". Cf. *Laws* 890D, "Law and art are children of the intellect" (*nous*). Sensation (*aisthêsis*) and pleasure (*hêdône*) are irrational (alogos, see *Timaeus* 28A, 47D, 69D). In the *Gorgias*, the irrational is that which cannot give an account of itself, that which is unreasonable, has no *raison d'être*. See also Philo, *Legum Allegoriarum* I.48, "For as grass is the fod of irrational beings, so has the sensibly-perceptible (*to aisthêton*) ben assigned to the irrational part of the soul." *Aisthêsis* is just what the biologist now calls "irritability."

"Pathology ... 2. The study of the passions or emotions" (*The Oxford English Dictionary*, 1933, VII, 554). The "psychology of art" is not a science of art but of the way in which we are affected by works of art. An affection (*pathêma*) is passive; making or doing (*poiêma*, *ergon*) is an activity.
